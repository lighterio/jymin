Jymin is "JavaScript You Minify", meaning Jymin scripts get concatenated with
your application code and minfied within a single function closure. Functions
you use will remain intact after minification, and functions you don't use
will drop out. The end result is that browsers will download and run
your code quickly, enabling the most responsive experiences possible.
